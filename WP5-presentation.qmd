# Open Music Europe {.scrollable transition="slide"}

![](png/ome/Banner_OME_Software_Ecosystem.png){width="800"}

## Structure of the presentation

-   [x] WP5: a capstone of WP1/2/3/4
-   [x] Dissemination and Communication
-   [x] Open Music Observatory: Towards a European Music Dataspace
-   [x] Listen Local Slovakia, SKCMDb
-   [x] Exploitation
-   [x] Questions

## Ambition

According to the grant agreement's ambition, Open Music Europe "aims to contribute to the aim of creating a decentralised European intelligence hub where centralised data collection and analysis have failed in the music industry during the past 20 years. We envision the Open Data Observatory as a decentralised, complementary service to the ESSnet system (Eurostat and the national statistics offices) and the planned, centralised European Music Observatory."

## Music economy

-   The `WP1 pilot project` will demonstrate the capacity of improved data to increase artist revenues within a short- to medium-term timeframe. These valuations will depend on standardised data from GESAC, CISAC, and potentially from IFPI, Aepo-Artis, and SCAPR or other organisations. This T1.3 is supported by the T1.2, T2.2, and T3.2 collected data as identified in T1.1

## Music diverstiy and circulation

-   The `WP2 Music diversity and circulation will culminate` in a pilot project conducted in Slovakia, Lithuania, Ukraine and Bulgaria by SOZA, MXF, MEU and MUSICAUTOR. The WP2 pilot project will demonstrate the feasibility of increasing local artist representation in radio and streaming, via trustworthy AI and evidence-based regulatory policy. This T2.3 is supported by the T1.2, T2.2, and T3.2 collected data as identified in T2.1.

## Music, society, and citizenship

-   The `WP3 Music, society, and citizenship` will culminate in a pilot project conducted in Italy by MIH. The WP3 pilot project will demonstrate the ability of reproducible research and innovation tools to help MSMEs comply with emerging social and environmental sustainability regulations, at a viable cost. This T3.3 is supported by the T3.2, T2.2 and T1.2 collected data as identified in T1.1.

## Innovation and future trends

-   The `WP4 Innovation and future trends` will culminate in a pilot project conducted in Germany and Italy by HEARDIS. The WP4 pilot project will demonstrate the use of improved metadata collection and trustworthy AI to create in-store playlists that reflect the diversity and robustness of local music scenes in cities in which particular stores are located. This task is supported by the data collection and depostied in the observatory.

## Methodology

-   [x] Open Policy Analysis for identifying needs and methodologies
-   [x] Eurostat indicator design for filling the data gaps
-   [x] eXtreme Design software- and ontology design patterns for identifying open source software needs

## An ecosystem with interoperable, federated music data {.scrollable transition="slide"}

![A Data Ecosystem is a “purposeful collaboration or partnership consuming, producing and providing interoperable data and related resources” [@bdva_data_sharing_spaces_interoperability_2023, p19]. The chart is a modification of the schematic chart of [dataspaces.info](https://dataspaces.info/).](png/music-data-ecosystem/music_data_ecosystem.png)

## Data space

::: {layout-ncol="2" style="font-size: 70%;"}
[![“Data Sharing Spaces and Interoperability.” Click to download paper.](png/dataspace/music_data_space_SQ.png){width="500"}](https://bdva.eu/download/92/publications/3841/data-sharing-spaces-and-interoperability-bdva-discussion-paper-december-2023.pdf)

A data space is a data and knowledge sharing and coordination tool for the “public collection of findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable quality data and related resources consumed, produced and provided by identified participants, each respecting societal values and operating within an explicit framework of trust and governance”. While it relies on modern computer and data science, it is mainly a business and data regulatory innovation to foster cooperation among many "small" data owners in the era of big data.

### Dataspace

![](png/dataspace/data_sharing_value_wheel_16x9.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

### Definition

"A data space is an ecosystem of exchange, processing, sharing and provision of data between trusted partners, for a fee or not. It is not about copying or repatriating data centrally, but about ensuring that each data holder has full control over the conditions (e.g., who, when, and under what condition) of access to their data."

EBU and Gaia-X. 2022."[Dataspace for Cultural and Creative Industries](https://gaia-x.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/EBU_position-paper_Media-Data-Space.pdf). Position Paper.

### SKCMDb

`Slovak Music Dataspace`: a data stewardship and technical coordination tool to collect information at SOZA, Hudobné centrum, Hudobný fond, SOSR, IAML and national libraries, which all have their own databases.

`Slovak Comprehensive Music Database`: a shared and public database for various taks, such as measuring the national radio quotas, or for educational applications.

### Listen Local

-   Trustworthy AI applications for exploiting the SKCMDb.

-   Playlist editor for radio editors to comply with quota

-   New classroom pedagogy with trustworthy recommenders for teenagers

### Harmonisation

![](png/viaf-2.png)

### Authority

-   `VIAF` (National Library): authority control for at least names and institutional names.
-   `ISWC` (SOZA): authority control for composer names, work titles, and work identifiers; harmonise with CISAC global database of works and work registry.
-   `ISRC` (IFPI, SLOVAGRAM): authority control for sound recordings, their titles, identifiers, harmonise with global sound recordings registries.
-   Harmonisation of local database identifiers with local identifiers: Wikibase, `Wikidata`.

### Definitions

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a music:

-   Classes, such as `Composer`, `Music Work`, `Recording`
-   Properties, such as *authorOf*, *perfomerOf*, *dateOfBirth*
-   Facets: `Work` sooner than *dateOfBirth* is not possible.

**Knowledge base**: invidivisual composers and their works described with our ontology. **Inference engine**: an AI application that matches `Works` with `Recordings`.

### Global

-   Europeana (EDM): which Slovak cultural organisation has the ambition to aggregate?
-   Dissemination to Wikipedia and Wikidata.

### Wikibase

-   A "private Wikidata" that allows to coordinate knowledge among cultural organisation. Example: Cultural organisations and ministry of Luxemburg, Swedish cultural organisations.

-   Allows to connect to the public Wikidata and Wikipedia to disseminate knowledge to global libraries, too.

-   We have support proposal from the developers (Wikimedia Deutschland). Reprex is building a team of three administrators.

# Slovak Music Dataspace 

## Listen Local + SKCMDb {.scrollable transition="slide"}

- [x] `Slovak Music Dataspace`: a data stewardship and technical coordination tool to collect information at SOZA, Hudobné centrum, Hudobný fond, SOSR, IAML and national libraries, which all have their own databases. The MVP of our pan-European observatory. 

- [x] `Slovak Comprehensive Music Database`: a shared and public database for various tasks, such as measuring the national radio quotas, or for educational applications. 

- [x] `Listen Local Applications`: The innovative applications of T2.2 and T4.2. (More in Exploitation)

## Personal data protection {.smaller .scrollable transition="slide"}

::: panel-tabset
### GDPR

-   We take data protection very seriously. We are building a *trustworthy data system* with *trustworthy AI*.

-   In most cases, we seek explicit opt-in from all musicians of Slovakia.

-   In some cases, we offer opt-out from existing authorisation.

-   Hudobné centrum and IAML libraries fall under GDPR exceptions (a library catalogue cannot work without the names of authors.)

-   Help musicians, their enterprises and institutions to take back control.

-   Educate our users about complex data systems and AI.

### Purposes

-   `SOZA`: improved collective rights management; reduced payment lateness and lost payment, reduced documentation costs.

-   `Hudobné centrum`: public sector obligations fulfilled at best available technology (documentation, education and promotion.)

-   `IKP-Policy`: various policy measurements and indicators, including a potential measuring of the Slovak local content requirements in the broadcasting law.

-   Voluntary: improving the visibility of opt-in artists, reducing missed payments, combating misinformation and data breaches on the internet.

-   Special provisions for libraries.

### Voluntary registry

-   Explicit opt-in for music creators, performers, and other people under GDPR for purposes not covered by SOZA and Hudobné centrum statutes.

-   Motivation for opt-in: visibility for notable artists, public documentation services (we improve their metadata that will benefit their career.)

### Institutional registry

-   No GDPR regulations for registering the data of legal person (but of course, they must apply GDPR for their musicians)
-   KULT surveys and other SOSR surveys
-   VIAF, QID, PIC
:::

## Data Education Plan {.smaller .scrollable transition="slide"}

::: panel-tabset
### Data protection authority

-   Early involvement of the authority to avoid surprises
-   Policy/theoretical questions, for example, unlimited approval rights of descendants (a 17th century composer may have 10,000 descendants.)

### Educate SOZA bodies

-   Educate the supervisory board, internal staff
-   Artist ambassadors to educate the membership

### HC stakeholders

-   Consultation with the national library
-   Improved data ingestion, with improved GDPR opt-in
-   Inform the IAML libraries about the data space
