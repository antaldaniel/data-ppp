	abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the reciprocal relationship between {VIAF} (R) and Wikidata and their possible roles in the semantic web environment. It deals with their data, their approach, their domain, and their stakeholders, with particular attention to identification as a fundamental goal of Universal Bibliographic Control. After examining interrelationships among {VIAF}, Wikidata, libraries and other {GLAM} institutions, a double approach is used to compare {VIAF} and Wikidata: first, a quantitative analysis of {VIAF} and Wikidata data on personal entities, presented in eight tables; and second, a qualitative comparison of several general characteristics, such as purpose, scope, organizational and theoretical approach, data harvesting and management (shown in table 9). Quantitative data and qualitative comparison show that {VIAF} and Wikidata are quite different in their purpose, scope, organizational and theoretical approach, data harvesting, and management. The study highlights the reciprocal role of {VIAF} and Wikidata and its helpfulness in the worldwide bibliographical context and in the semantic web environment and outlines new perspectives for research and cooperation.},

The project seeks to align with the original democratic spirit of the show, giving each artist an equal opportunity to be discovered through an interactive map. Overall, the goal of “Beyond the Fountain” is to explore the Society of Independent Artists in a new way, with an emphasis on bringing lesser-known artists to light.

	abstract = {Knowledge graphs are being deployed in many enterprises and institutions. An easy-to-use, well-designed infrastructure for such knowledge graphs is not obvious. After the success of Wikidata, many institutions are looking at the software infrastructure behind it, namely Wikibase. In this paper we introduce Wikibase, describe its different software components and the tools that have emerged around it. In particular, we detail how Wikibase is used as the infrastructure behind the "{EU} Knowledge Graph", which is deployed at the European Commission. This graph mainly integrates projects funded by the European Union, and is used to make these projects visible to and easily accessible by citizens with no technical background. Moreover, we explain how this deployment compares to a more classical approach to building {RDF} knowledge graphs, and point to other projects that are using Wikibase as an underlying infrastructure.},

Then we introduce the Virtual Encyclopedia of Bulgarian Icons ({BIDL}) and describe how we ex-ported it to Wikidata, while coreferencing to iconographers, saints, locations; and the extra info we added for such entities.

	shorttitle = {Wikidata},
	abstract = {Traditional {UBC} provides for the standardization of bibliographic records, the creation of guidelines dedicated to national bibliographic agencies, the creation of the {UNIMARC} format, and the curation of authority data. Bibliographic Control has deeply evolved since {IFLA} theorization during the Seventies of the {XX} Century, due to the availability of a very large range of new bibliographic tools. At the beginning of the {XXI} century, {UBC} is quite different and involves new actors. Among these, Wikidata has a background greatly different from that of libraries as institutions: it is not devoted to bibliographic data, nor it is limited to personal authority control, but its value in {AC} tools like {VIAF} and National Libraries authority files is undiscussed.After a presentation on how Wikidata items describe and identify bibliographic entities, the authors underline how the existence, use and reuse of Wikidata affect the way the professional community thinks about {UBC}. Wikidata is a clear example of the need for a new approach to identification and description, that are deeply intertwined. Secondly, from a Wikidata perspective, the relevance of globally preferred and variant access points is lessened. Moreover, descriptions in Wikidata - although conceptually very similar to the traditional one - present differences and potentialities that a traditional description does not have and cannot have. Also from a theoretical perspective, Wikidata offers a pragmatic way to think globally and act locally. In fact, it shows that there is no need for one standardization of practices for establishing the headings and structure of authority records in one international form;.instead, users' convenience can be achieved by a technological infrastructure capable to present to each user the information about an entity in its own language and script. Additionally, Wikidata is the most evident example of the distributed and diffused approach of the semantic web to the issue of the universal identification of the entities. Also, Wikidata identification and description show that authority and bibliographic control must be tackled as just a part of the more general topic of the creation of a knowledge graph of all human knowledge by means of linked open data. Lastly, this objective cannot be achieved only by contribution, cooperation, and networking of large national agencies (as in {VIAF}), as a larger number of stakeholders must be involved to achieve a {UBC} also including the full indexing of any kind of scientific communication [Publisher's text].},

For name authority thesauri in particular I would like to suggest a fundamental break with the current distributed linked data paradigm: to make a transition from a multitude of different identifiers to using a single, universal identifier for all relevant named entities, in the form of the Wikidata identifier. Wikidata (https://wikidata.org) seems to be evolving into a major authority hub that is lowering barriers to access the web of data for everyone. Using the Wikidata identifier of notable entities as a common identifier for connecting resources has significant benefits compared to traversing the ever-growing linked data cloud. When the use of Wikidata reaches a critical mass, for some institutions, Wikidata could even serve as an authority control mechanism.},

This paper presents our work regarding detecting and extending links between Wikidata and {COURAGE} entities with respect to cultural heritage data. The {COURAGE} project explored the methods for cultural opposition in the socialist era (cc. 1950–1990), highlighting the variety of alternative cultural scenes that flourished in Eastern Europe before 1989. We describe our methods and results in discovering common entities in the two datasets, and our solution for automating this task. Furthermore, it is shown how it was possible to enrich the data in Wikidata and to establish new, bi-directional connections between {COURAGE} and Wikidata. Hence, the audience of both databases will have a more complete view of the matched entities.},
