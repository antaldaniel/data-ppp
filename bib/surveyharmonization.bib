    abstract = { Ex-post harmonization of survey data creates new opportunities for research by extending the geographical and/or time coverage of analyses. Researchers increasingly combine data from different survey projects to analyze them as a single dataset, and while teams engaged in data harmonization continue to expand the information they provide to end users, there are still no commonly agreed standards for the documentation of data processing. Existing harmonization project typically opt for recode scripts that are generally hard to read, modify, and reuse, although some projects make efforts to facilitate verification and reproduction. This paper describes an alternative procedure and a set of simple tools for the exploration, recoding, and documentation of harmonization of survey data, relying on crosswalks. The presented tools are flexible and software-agnostic. The illustrative example uses the programming language R and spreadsheets—both common software choices among social scientists. Harmonization of variables on trust in institutions from four major cross-national survey projects serves as an illustration of the proposed workflow and of opportunities harmonization creates. }

Generally, {SDR} has been developed in view of harmonizing several international survey projects but can be applied to national projects as well. In {SDR}, data processing is documented via different types of metadata. {SDR} draws on the literatures of survey data quality, ex post harmonization, and multilevel modeling to develop formal rules that researchers can employ to do so. For each dimension, {SDR} recommends constructing control variables that reflect methodological variability in the source survey data and to make them available, as metadata, in the harmonized dataset. {SDR} considers information on the transformation of original items into the target variables and the overall quality of the source variables.},

Harmonization controls and item quality controls are part of this classification. The construction of item metadata is part of the logic of the Survey Data Recycling analytic framework. To illustrate the approach described, the chapter provides two examples of target variables from the Harmonization Project dataset, which was constructed for analyzing determinants of political participation in a cross-national perspective. The first example pertained to controls for the target variable “trust in the national parliament”, which is one of the most popular survey items on political trust in general; it is also theoretically relevant for peoples' propensity to demonstrate. The second example involved controls for the target variable “participation in demonstrations”.},

We examine the institutional and intellectual history of nine large scale ex post survey data harmonization ({SDH}) projects in the social sciences from the 1980s to the 2010s. An interdisciplinary methodological field of {SDH} slowly emerges, facilitated in part by a partnership between academia and government and from the coordinated contributions of social scientists, survey methodologists and computer scientists. While there has been a learning process, it is in terms of accumulated practicalities, and not with the coordination or institutional apparatus one would expect from a 30 year effort.},

To enable valid conclusions from this type of research, data from the respective surveys must be comparable. To ensure comparability, it is often necessary to harmonize data. This chapter distinguishes three approaches to harmonizing survey data. It discusses methods to assess the quality of harmonized data which also lead to specific requirements for the documentation and distribution of harmonized data. The chapter outlines recommendations for producers of harmonized datasets. Whatever the solution selected, comprehensive and structured documentation of all steps in the survey life cycle and all decisions made in the process of harmonizing data is essential. Dissemination of harmonized datasets has to include not only the harmonized data but also the original data and well structured documentation.

However, equivalence of measures does not necessarily mean that the measurement instruments used in different countries are all the same. Instead it is essential that they measure the same dimension. Thus, functional equivalence is more precisely what is required (Dogan and Pelassy 1990). Using functional equivalent measures in cross-national surveys ensures that data can be compared because the resulting measures reflect the same phenomenon, that is the social circumstances that one wants to measure (see Przeworki and Teune 1970: 39; Wendt-Hildebrandt, Hildebrandt and Krebs 1983: 46). This makes the criterion of functional equivalence to a validity criterion. But how is functional equivalence of measures achieved?},

The Eurobarometer measures the European population’s attitudes about various issues related to Europe. The informational value of the Eurobarometer is viewed as quite high, since the surveys, which are conducted twice a year, generate a large quantity of data. This article investigates the role of the Eurobarometer in the process of European integration by analysing the methodological foundations of the Eurobarometer and discussing its weaknesses. The final section addresses the issue of whether the European Commission, as the contracting entity, utilizes the Eurobarometer as a political instrument to promote support for the process of European integration. It is argued here that the Commission’s instrumentalisation of the Eurobarometer jeopardizes its informational value, whereas at the same time the political benefits of this shift remain debatable.},
